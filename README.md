# Emotion-AI
Have you ever experienced the frustration that comes with an insensitive, typical emotionless response from platforms like ChatGPT? To solve this, we created an *incwedible* web-app called EmotionAI, which can detect what emotions you're feeling through analyzing your facial expressions, and responding accordingly!

In other words, we trained the machine to be able to analyze human emotion using thousands of data images. For now, we only trained the machine to detect two distinct emotions: happiness and sadness. After detection, when a user types in a prompt, our AI will generate a response that will match the sentiment of the user. The biggest difficulty came in training the machine to properly an efficiently discern the current emotion of the user.
